# CCBS-STRADL GitHub Organisation

-----------------------

## Leavers Checklist

### Code

- [ ] Ensure code for projects is on GitHub. Ideally [ccbs-stradl](https://github.com/ccbs-stradl), otherwise your own personal GitHub account.
- [ ] Ensure code on GitHub is well documented, ie. include a [README file](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) and good comments in the code.
- [ ] For code with an associated manuscript ensure it is clear where associated scripts for text, figures and tables in the manuscript are located. For example, create a README file that contains each subheading in the Results section and list which scripts were used to generate results, figures and tables in each subsection. This is especially important for on-going, unpublished projects with draft manuscripts.

### Data

- [ ] Remove or archive data on DataStore and Eddie that will not be used by others. See University guides for archiving data.
